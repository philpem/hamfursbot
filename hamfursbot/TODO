Refactor callsign search resolution order
=========================================
 1. See if we have an alias stored for the callsign
 2. Is callsign Canadian? Do lookup on local IC data
    *Exists there? Format and return data +/- alias
 3. Is callsign American? 
    a. Attempt lookup on callook.info
      * Exists there? then:
        - Get VE information locally, add info to output 
        - Format and return data +/- alias
 4. Attempt hamqth lookup.
    * Exists there? Format and return data +/- alias
 5. Get theoretical callsign country and return flag +/- alias if one is stored.
